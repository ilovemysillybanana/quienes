# Qui√©nes

Why this name? For those of you who took a language in high school, it might be obvious. For those did not, it just means, "who" in Spanish.

### Why does this exist?
I was inspired to create this over a weekend when parsing horrible amounts of text given to a colleague and myself from multiple platforms using multiple methods that generated differing outputs. These files were just different enough to bring us great heartache.

### Goals
* Support AIX, Windows, Solaris, and Linux Operating Systems
* Return the output in a neatly formatted JSON File
* Never cry again
