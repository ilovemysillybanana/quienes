# QuiÃ©nes

Why this name? For those of you who took a language in high school, it might be obvious. For those did not, it just means, "who" in Spanish.

## Why does this exist?

I was inspired to create this over a weekend when parsing horrible amounts of text given to a colleague and myself from multiple platforms using multiple methods that generated differing outputs. These files were just different enough to bring us great heartache.

## Goals

- Support AIX, Windows, Solaris, and Linux Operating Systems
- Return the output in a neatly formatted JSON File
- Never cry again

## Working

- AIX? ( I am not able to test this. )
- Linux
- Solaris
- Windows

## Instructions

Run the jar as if it were any other java application, you can send the output anywhere you'd like using standard terminal functions. You can specify an input file to designate groups with differing permissions and have that be reflected in your output.

```
java -jar quienes.jar
# redirect output
java -jar quienes.jar > output.json
```
#### specify input file

```
java -jar quienes.jar -f /path/to/file
```

#### Example Input File
Input files are in json format, it is expected that the team(s) running these should be able to categorize and their privileged users and groups.

```
{
  "elevated_groups": ["root", "jose"],
  "elevated_users": ["root", "rundeck", "jose"]
}
```

Each user will return an array of `elevated_groups`, if they belong to any. If they do not, but their name is contained by the group `elevated_users` they will return an `elevated_user: true`

## Expected Output

## Contributions

If you're interested in this project, you can help by writing tests, testing on different platforms, sending issues. Really any and all help is appreciated. Let's never cry again together.
