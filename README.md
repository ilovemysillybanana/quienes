# QuiÃ©nes

Why this name? For those of you who took a language in high school, it might be obvious. For those did not, it just means, "who" in Spanish.

### Why does this exist?
I was inspired to create this over a weekend when parsing horrible amounts of text given to a colleague and myself from multiple platforms using multiple methods that generated differing outputs. These files were just different enough to bring us great heartache.

### Goals
* Support AIX, Windows, Solaris, and Linux Operating Systems
* Return the output in a neatly formatted JSON File
* Never cry again

### Working
* Linux
* Windows

### Instructions
Run the jar as if it were any other java application, you can send the output anywhere you'd like using standard terminal functions.

```
java -jar quienes.jar
# redirect output
java -jar quienes.jar > output.json
```

### Expected Output
